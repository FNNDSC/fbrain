\section{Introduction}

BTK stands for Baby Brain Toolkit. This toolkit is developed in the context of
the Fbrain ERC project: ``Computational Anatomy of Fetal
Brain''\footnote{http://lsiit-miv.u-strasbg.fr/miv/index.php?contenu=erc}. 
Studies about brain maturation aim at providing a better understanding of brain
development and links between brain changes and cognitive development. Such
studies are of great interest for diagnosis help and clinical course of
development and treatment of illnesses. Several teams have begun to make 3D maps
of developing brain structures from children to young adults. However, working
out the development of fetal and neonatal brain remains an open issue. This
project aims at jumping over several theoretical and practical barriers and at
going beyond the formal description of the brain maturation thanks to the
development of a realistic numerical model of brain aging.

\subsection{Installation}

\subsubsection{Dependencies}

Baby Brain Toolkit (BTK) depends on:
\begin{itemize}
 \item CMake (www.cmake.org): this library can be installed for debian-based
distribution using the following command line : \texttt{apt-get install
cmake cmake-curses-gui}
 \item Insight Toolkit (ITK) version 3.20 (it can be download at www.itk.org). Extract this file (the directory InsightToolkit-3.20 is created). Make another directory where all the build files will be placed, e.g. InsightToolkit-3.20-build:
\begin{verbatim}
mkdir InsightToolkit-3.20-build
cd InsightToolkit-3.20-build
cmake ../InsightToolkit-3.20/
\end{verbatim}
This will bring up the CMake configuration screen. Use \texttt{[t]} to toggle the advanced mode. Make the following changes:
\begin{verbatim}
BUILD_TYPE = Release
ITK_USE_OPTIMIZED_REGISTRATION = ON
ITK_USE_REVIEW = ON
\end{verbatim}
Then press \texttt{[c]} to configure and \texttt{[g]} to generate the make file. Finally, type \texttt{make} at the prompt to obtain the final build of ITK.
 \item Tclap library: this library can be installed for debian-based
distribution using the following command line : \texttt{apt-get install
libtclap-dev}
 \item OpenMP library: this library can be installed for debian-based
distribution using the following command line : \texttt{apt-get install
libgomp1}
 \item VTK library: this library can be installed for debian-based
distribution using the following command line : \texttt{apt-get install
libvtk5-dev}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Download and compile the BTK sources}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Install Git: this library can be installed for debian-based distribution using the following command line : \texttt{apt-get install git-core}
 \item Get the BTK sources: \texttt{git clone https://github.com/rousseau/fbrain.git }
 \item Then:
\begin{verbatim}
mkdir fbrain-build
cd fbrain-build
cmake ../fbrain
make
\end{verbatim}
\end{itemize}
