\section{Introduction}

BTK stands for Baby Brain Toolkit. This toolkit is developed in the context of
the Fbrain ERC project: ``Computational Anatomy of Fetal
Brain''\footnote{http://lsiit-miv.u-strasbg.fr/miv/index.php?contenu=erc}. 
Studies about brain maturation aim at providing a better understanding of brain
development anEstanislao, Nadège et Valerio Oubel--Salis

le            2011d links between brain changes and cognitive development. Such
studies are of great interest for diagnosis help and clinical course of
development and treatment of illnesses. Several teams have begun to make 3D maps
of developing brain structures from children to young adults. However, working
out the development of fetal and neonatal brain remains an open issue. This
project aims at jumping over several theoretical and practical barriers and at
going beyond the formal description of the brain maturation thanks to the
development of a realistic numerical model of brain aging.
