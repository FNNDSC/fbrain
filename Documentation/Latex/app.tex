\section{Applications}

\subsection{Denoising}

\begin{description}
 \item[btkNLMDenoising] This program applies a non-local mean filter to a 3D image for denoising purpose. Usage: \texttt{-i input\_image\_filename -o output\_image\_filename}. The best results are usually obtained by using a mask (or a padding value).
\end{description}

\begin{description}
 \item[btkNLMDenoising4DImage] This program applies a non-local mean filter to each 3D image of a 4D image, for denoising purpose. Usage: \texttt{-i input\_image\_filename -o output\_image\_filename}. The best results are usually obtained by using a mask (or a padding value).
\end{description}


\subsection{Tractography}

\begin{description}
 \item[btkTractography] This program performs a probabilistic tractography using a particle filtering. Usage: \texttt{-d dwi\_image\_filename -v dwi\_gradient\_vectors -m white\_matter\_mask -l seeds\_la\-bel\_image}.
