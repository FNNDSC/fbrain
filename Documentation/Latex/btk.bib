The study tested the standard b values that are commonly used in the routine clinical setting. METHODS: Ten normal volunteers (five men and five women) with a mean age of 26.3 years (range, 22-32 years) were scanned using a 1.5-T clinical magnetic resonance unit. Single-shot echo-planar imaging was used for diffusion-weighted imaging with a diffusion-sensitizing gradient in 32 orientations. The b values of 700, 1,400, 2,100, and 2,800 s/m(2) were used. Data postprocessing was performed using multi-tensor methods. The depiction of the optic nerves, optic tracts, and decussation of superior cerebellar peduncles were assessed. RESULTS: The depictions of the nerve fibers were independent of the b values tested. CONCLUSION: The depiction of crossing fibers by HARDI-based multi-tensor tractography is not substantially influenced by b values ranging from 700 to 2,800 s/m(2). Thus, the optimum b value within this range may be the lowest one considering the higher signal to noise ratio.",

	abstract = "Short-axis PROPELLER-EPI (SAP-EPI) has been proven to be very effective in providing high-resolution diffusion-weighted and diffusion tensor data. The self-navigation capabilities of SAP-EPI allow one to correct for motion, phase errors, and geometric distortion. However, in the presence of patient motion, the change in the effective diffusion- encoding direction (i.e. the b-matrix) between successive PROPELLER 'blades' can decrease the accuracy of the estimated diffusion tensors, which might result in erroneous reconstruction of white matter tracts in the brain. In this study, we investigate the effects of alterations in the b-matrix as a result of patient motion on the example of SAP-EPI DTI and eliminate these effects by incorporating our novel single-step non-linear diffusion tensor estimation scheme into the SAP-EPI post-processing procedure. Our simulations and in-vivo studies showed that, in the presence of patient motion, correcting the b-matrix is necessary in order to get more accurate diffusion tensor and white matter pathway reconstructions.

Unfortunately, these diffusion gradients cause geometric distortion that must be corrected before estimation of the tensor. In the present paper we suggest and implement a method for retrospective correction of these distortions firmly based on a physical model for the diffusion-weighted images. This method simultaneously estimates subject movement and distortion parameters by finding the set of parameters that minimizes residual error when fitting data to the diffusion tensor model. We show how this notion can be formalized as a quadratic form thereby facilitating the implementation of a rapid algorithm. In addition, we suggest models for how distortions vary with slice position and gradient direction that allow us to substantially reduce the dimensionality of the parameter space. Our results indicate that we are able to estimate both eddy current-induced distortion and subject movement directly from the data without need of any additional measurements.",

To resolve this we suggest acquiring two images for each diffusion gradient; one with bottom-up and one with top-down traversal of k-space in the phase-encode direction. This achieves the simultaneous goals of providing information on the underlying displacement field and intensity maps with adequate spatial sampling density even in distorted areas.

Diffusion tensor imaging quantifies the diffusion of water within tissues and can assess microstructural abnormalities in the developing preterm brain. Tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) is an automated observer-independent method of aligning fractional anisotropy (FA) images from multiple subjects to allow groupwise comparisons of diffusion tensor imaging data. We applied TBSS to test the hypothesis that preterm infants have reduced fractional anisotropy in specific regions of white matter compared to term-born controls. We studied 26 preterm infants with no evidence of focal lesions on conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at term equivalent age and 6 healthy term-born control infants. We found that the centrum semiovale, frontal white matter and the genu of the corpus callosum showed significantly lower FA in the preterm group. Infants born at less than or equal to 28 weeks gestational age (n=11) displayed additional reductions in FA in the external capsule, the posterior aspect of the posterior limb of the internal capsule and the isthmus and middle portion of the body of the corpus callosum. This study demonstrates that TBSS provides an observer-independent method of identifying white matter abnormalities in the preterm brain at term equivalent age in the absence of focal lesions.",

	abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional MRI, diffusion tensor MRI, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and positron-emission tomographic scans may be aligned to intraoperative MRI to enhance visualization and navigation during image-guided neurosurgery. However, several effects (both machine- and patient-induced distortions) lead to significant geometric distortion of intraoperative MRI. Therefore, a precise alignment of these image modalities requires correction of the geometric distortion. We propose and evaluate a novel method to compensate for the geometric distortion of intraoperative 0.5-T MRI in image-guided neurosurgery. METHODS: In this initial pilot study, 11 neurosurgical procedures were prospectively enrolled. The scheme used to correct the geometric distortion is based on a nonrigid registration algorithm introduced by our group. This registration scheme uses image features to establish correspondence between images. It estimates a smooth geometric distortion compensation field by regularizing the displacements estimated at the correspondences. A patient-specific linear elastic material model is used to achieve the regularization. The geometry of intraoperative images (0.5 T) is changed so that the images match the preoperative MRI scans (3 T). RESULTS: We compared the alignment between preoperative and intraoperative imaging using 1) only rigid registration without correction of the geometric distortion, and 2) rigid registration and compensation for the geometric distortion. We evaluated the success of the geometric distortion correction algorithm by measuring the Hausdorff distance between boundaries in the 3-T and 0.5-T MRIs after rigid registration alone and with the addition of geometric distortion correction of the 0.5-T MRI. Overall, the mean magnitude of the geometric distortion measured on the intraoperative images is 10.3 mm with a minimum of 2.91 mm and a maximum of 21.5 mm. The measured accuracy of the geometric distortion compensation algorithm is 1.93 mm. There is a statistically significant difference between the accuracy of the alignment of preoperative and intraoperative images, both with and without the correction of geometric distortion (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The major contributions of this study are 1) identification of geometric distortion of intraoperative images relative to preoperative images, 2) measurement of the geometric distortion, 3) application of nonrigid registration to compensate for geometric distortion during neurosurgery, 4) measurement of residual distortion after geometric distortion correction, and 5) phantom study to quantify geometric distortion.",

Therefore, sshEPI was combined with SENSitivity Encoding (SENSE) to further increase EPI's potential for stroke imaging. Eight healthy volunteers and a consecutive series of patients (N = 8) with suspected stroke were examined with diffusion-weighted SENSE-sshEPI using different reduction factors (1.0 < or = R < or = 3.0). Additionally, a high-resolution diffusion-weighted SENSE-sshEPI scan was included. All examinations were diagnostic and of better quality than conventional sshEPI. No ghostings or aliasing artifacts were discernible, and EPI-related image distortions were markedly diminished. Chemical shift artifacts and eddy current-induced image warping were still present, although to a markedly smaller extent. Measured direction-dependent diffusion-coefficients and isotropic diffusion values were comparable to previous findings but showed less fluctuation. We have demonstrated the technical feasibility and clinical applicability of diffusion-weighted SENSE-sshEPI in patients with subacute stroke. Because of the faster k-space traversal, this novel technique is able to reduce typical EPI artifacts and increase spatial resolution while simultaneously remaining insensitive to bulk motion.",

It consists of estimating an effective diffusion tensor, Deff, within a voxel, and then displaying useful quantities derived from it. We show how the phenomenon of anisotropic diffusion of water (or metabolites) in anisotropic tissues, measured noninvasively by these NMR methods, is exploited to determine fiber tract orientation and mean particle displacements. Once Deff is estimated from a series of NMR pulsed-gradient, spin-echo experiments, a tissue's three orthotropic axes can be determined. They coincide with the eigenvectors of Deff, while the effective diffusivities along these orthotropic directions are the eigenvalues of Deff. Diffusion ellipsoids, constructed in each voxel from Deff, depict both these orthotropic axes and the mean diffusion distances in these directions. Moreover, the three scalar invariants of Deff, which are independent of the tissue's orientation in the laboratory frame of reference, reveal useful information about molecular mobility reflective of local microstructure and anatomy. Inherently tensors (like Deff) describing transport processes in anisotropic media contain new information within a macroscopic voxel that scalars (such as the apparent diffusivity, proton density, T1, and T2) do not.",

Such geometric distortions can be characterized and corrected in brain imaging data using magnification (M), translation (T), and shear (S) distortion parameters derived from separate water phantom calibration experiments. Here we examine the practicalities of using separate phantom calibration data to correct high b-value diffusion tensor imaging data by investigating the stability of these distortion parameters, and hence the eddy currents, with time. It is found that M, T, and S vary only slowly with time (i.e., on the order of weeks), so that calibration scans need not be performed after every patient examination. This not only minimises the scan time required to collect the calibration data, but also the computational time needed to characterize these eddy current induced distortions. Examples of how measurements of diffusion anisotropy are improved using this post-processing scheme are also presented.+",

Comparison of cerebral diffusion properties between preterm infants and fetuses of corresponding ages should assist in determining the impact of premature ex utero life on brain maturation. OBJECTIVE: To assess in utero maturation-dependent microstructural changes of fetal cerebral white matter using diffusion tensor MR imaging. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An echoplanar sequence with diffusion gradient (b=700 s/mm(2)) applied in six non-colinear directions was performed between 31 and 37(+3) weeks of gestation in 24 fetuses without cerebral abnormality on T1- and T2-weighted images. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) were measured in the white matter. RESULTS: Mean ADC values were 1.8 microm(2)/ms in the centrum semiovale, 1.2 microm(2)/ms in the splenium of the corpus callosum and 1.1 microm(2)/ms in the pyramidal tract. The paired Wilcoxon rank test showed significant differences in ADC between these three white matter regions. Mean FA values were 1.1\%, 3.8\% and 4.7\%, respectively, in the centrum semiovale, corpus callosum and pyramidal tract. A significant age-related decrease in ADC and an increase in FA towards term were demonstrated in the pyramidal tract and corpus callosum. CONCLUSION: Diffusion tensor imaging in utero can provide a quantitative assessment of the microstructural development of fetal white matter. Anisotropic parameters of the diffusion tensor should improve with technical advances.",

Echoplanar imaging provides a robust method of acquiring diffusion-weighted images free of motion artifact. However, initial experience with clinical MRI systems indicates that calculation of artifact-free ADC maps from a series of echo-planar diffusion-weighted images is not necessarily straight-forward. One of the problems is that frequency shifts resulting from eddy currents can cause misregistration of base diffusion-weighted images. In this study, an on-line correction method that overcomes this problem is described, and phantom and human images that demonstrate the validity of the technique are presented. The method uses a non-phase-encoded reference scan to correct the phase of each echo in the echo train, and can provide ADC maps that are free of misregistration artifacts, without the need for off-line postprocessing.",

Combined with the previously proposed multichannel modulation postprocessing algorithm (Chen and Wyrwicz, MRM 1999;41:1206-1213), the encoded phase error information can be used to effectively remove geometric distortions in subsequent EPI scans. The proposed EPI distortion correction technique has been shown to be effective in removing distortions due to gradient waveform imperfections and phase gradient-induced eddy current effects. In addition, this new method retains advantages of the earlier method, such as simultaneous correction of different off-resonance factors without use of a complicated phase unwrapping procedure. The effectiveness of this technique is illustrated with EPI studies on phantoms and animal subjects. Implementation to different versions of EPI sequences is also described.

	abstract = "The development of cognitive functions during childhood relies on several neuroanatomical maturation processes. Among these processes is myelination of the white matter pathways, which speeds up electrical conduction. Quantitative indices of such structural processes can be obtained in vivo with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), but their physiological significance remains uncertain. Here, we investigated the microstructural correlates of early functional development by combining DTI and visual event-related potentials (VEPs) in 15 one- to 4-month-old healthy infants. Interindividual variations of the apparent conduction speed, computed from the latency of the first positive VEP wave (P1), were significantly correlated with the infants' age and DTI indices measured in the optic radiations. This demonstrates that fractional anisotropy and transverse diffusivity are structural markers of functionally efficient myelination. Moreover, these indices computed along the optic radiations showed an early wave of maturation in the anterior region, with the posterior region catching up later in development, which suggests two asynchronous fronts of myelination in both the geniculocortical and corticogeniculate fibers. Thus, in addition to microstructural information, DTI provides noninvasive exquisite information on the functional development of the brain in human infants.",

These techniques are widely used for fetal MRI and MRI of moving subjects and organs. Although high-quality slices are frequently acquired by these techniques, inter-slice motion leads to severe motion artifacts that are apparent in out-of-plane views. Slice sequential acquisitions do not enable 3D volume representation. In this study, we have developed a novel technique based on a slice acquisition model, which enables the reconstruction of a volumetric image from multiple-scan slice acquisitions. The superresolution volume reconstruction is formulated as an inverse problem of finding the underlying structure generating the acquired slices. We have developed a robust M-estimation solution which minimizes a robust error norm function between the model-generated slices and the acquired slices. The accuracy and robustness of this novel technique has been quantitatively assessed through simulations with digital brain phantom images as well as high-resolution newborn images. We also report here successful application of our new technique for the reconstruction of volumetric fetal brain MRI from clinically acquired data.",

However, DTI-derived variables are affected by various sources of signal uncertainty. The goal of this study was to establish an objective quality measure for DTI based on the nonparametric bootstrap methodology. The confidence intervals (CIs) of white matter (WM) fractional anisotropy (FA) and Clinear were determined by bootstrap analysis and submitted to histogram analysis. The effects of artificial noising and edge-preserving smoothing, as well as enhanced and reduced motion were studied in healthy volunteers. Gender and age effects on data quality as potential confounds in group comparison studies were analyzed. Additional noising showed a detrimental effect on the mean, peak position, and height of the respective CIs at 10\% of the original background noise. Inverse changes reflected data improvement induced by edge-preserving smoothing. Motion-dependent impairment was also well depicted by bootstrap-derived parameters. Moreover, there was a significant gender effect, with females displaying less dispersion (attributable to elevated SNR). In conclusion, the bootstrap procedure is a useful tool for assessing DTI data quality. It is sensitive to both noise and motion effects, and may help to exclude confounding effects in group comparisons.",

The distortions cause mis-registration between images with different diffusion-weighting, that then results in artifacts in quantitative diffusion images. A method is presented to measure the magnetic fields generated from the eddy currents for each of three orthogonal gradient pulse vectors, and then to use these to ascertain the image distortion that occurs in subsequent diffusion-weighted images with arbitrary gradient pulse vector amplitude and direction, and image plane orientation. The image distortion can then be reversed. Both temporal and spatial dependence of the residual eddy current induced fields are included in the analysis. Image distortion was substantially reduced by the correction scheme, for arbitrary slice position and angulation. This method of correction is unaffected by the changes in image contrast that occur due to diffusion weighting, and does not need any additional scanning time during the patient scan. It is particularly suitable for use with single-shot echo planar imaging.",

Revealing detailed anatomy at different stages of human fetal brain development not only aids in understanding this highly ordered process but also provides clues to detect abnormalities caused by genetic or environmental factors. However, anatomical studies of human brain development during this period are surprisingly scarce, and histology-based atlases have become available only recently. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), a recently developed technology of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), is capable of noninvasively delineating macroscopic anatomical components with high contrast and revealing structures at the microscopic level. In this article, the fetal brain white matter is explored using contrasts from DTI-derived images and axonal reconstruction from DTI tractography. The highly organized structures in the cerebral layer have been revealed with primary direction of diffusion tensors. Complementary to the histology, the DTI of the fetal brain provides a valuable resource to understand the structural development of the entire brain. The resultant database will provide reference standards for diagnostic radiology of premature newborns.",

Based on data from nine normal subjects, the amount of distortion caused by B0 susceptibility in the 3-T magnet was characterized. The distortion quality was validated by manually placing landmarks in the target and DTI images before and after distortion correction. The distortion was found to be up to 15 mm in the population-averaged map and could be more than 20 mm in individual images. Both qualitative demonstration and quantitative statistical results suggest that the highly elastic geometric distortion caused by spatial inhomogeneity of the B0 field in DTI using SS-EPI can be effectively corrected by LDDMM.

In this study, the problem of eddy current-induced geometric distortions that occur in diffusion images acquired with echo planar sequences was addressed. These geometric distortions produce artifacts in computed maps of diffusion parameters and are caused by misalignments in the individual diffusion-weighted images that comprise the diffusion data set. A new approach is presented to characterize and calibrate the eddy current effects, enabling the eddy current distortions to be corrected in sets of interleaved (or snapshot) echo planar diffusion images. Correction is achieved by acquiring one-dimensional field maps in the read and phase encode direction for each slice and each diffusion step. The method is then demonstrated through the correction of distortions in diffusion images of the human brain. It is shown that by using the eddy current correction scheme outlined, the eddy current-induced artifacts in the diffusion-weighted images are almost completely eliminated.

To date, these techniques have mainly been limited to postnatal MR studies of premature infants and newborns. The primary aim of this cross-sectional study was to assess the potential of in utero DTI and tractography to visualize the main projection and commissural pathways in 40 living, non-sedated human fetuses between 18 and 37 gestational weeks (GW) of age, with no structural brain pathologies. During a mean time of 1 min and 49 s, an axial, single-shot, echo planar DT sequence, with 32 diffusion gradient encoding directions and a reconstructed voxel size of 1.44 mm/1.45 mm/4.5 mm, was acquired. Most (90\%) of the fetuses were imaged in the cephalic presentation. In 40\% of examined fetuses, DTI measurements were robust enough to successfully calculate and visualize bilateral, craniocaudally oriented (mainly sensorimotor), and callosal trajectories in utero. Furthermore, fiber lengths, ADC, FA, and eigenvalues (lambda(1), lambda(2) and lambda(3)) were determined at different anatomically defined areas. FA values and the axial eigenvalue (lambda(1)) showed a characteristic distribution, with the highest values for the splenium, followed by the genu, the right, and the left posterior limb of the internal capsule. The right-sided sensorimotor trajectories were found to be significantly longer than on the left side (p=0.007), reflecting higher right-sided lambda(1) values (14 cases vs. 9 cases). Based on the good correlation of these initial in utero tractography results with prior documented postmortem and ex utero DTI data, this new imaging technique promises new insights into the normal and pathological development of the unborn child.",

The major difficulty of performing diffusion imaging in utero is the presence of motion. By modifying conventional single-shot spin-echo echo-planar DWI with a short repetition time sequence, a sequence that performs DWI and DTI within a breath-hold of the mother (13 sec and 18 sec, respectively) was devised. T(1) weighting caused by the use of short repetition times is compensated by interspersing diffusion imaging with additional b=0 image acquisitions. In utero fetal brain DWI and DTI were performed using this sequence. Quantitative analysis revealed minimal differences in the obtained apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC; directionally averaged ADC) values when using this sequence. The method can be readily implemented in a clinical setting and is especially useful when scanning mothers who cannot tolerate lengthier breath-holds.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Brain DTI data from 15 normal healthy volunteers were used to evaluate four spatial registration schemes within subjects to correct image distortions: noncorrection, SPM-based affine registration, AIR-based affine registration and AIR-based nonlinear polynomial warping. The performance of each distortion correction was assessed using: (a) quantitative parameters: tensor-fitting error (Ef), mean dispersion index (MDI), mean fractional anisotropy (MFA) and mean variance (MV) within 11 regions of interest (ROI) defined from homogeneous fiber bundles; and (b) fiber tractography through the uncinate fasciculus and the corpus callosum. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) were calculated to demonstrate the effects of distortion correction. Repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to investigate differences among the four registration paradigms. RESULTS: AIR-based nonlinear registration showed the best performance for reducing image distortions with respect to smaller Ef (P<.02), MDI (P<.01) and MV (P<.01) with larger MFA (P<.01). FA was decreased to correct distortions (P<.0001) whether the applied registration was linear or nonlinear and was lowest after nonlinear correction (P<.001). No significant differences were found in MD. CONCLUSION: In conventional DTI processing, anisotropic indices of FA can be misestimated by noncorrection or inappropriate distortion correction, which leads to an erroneous increase in FA. AIR-based nonlinear distortion correction would be required for a more accurate measurement of this diffusion parameter.",

	abstract = "In recent years, postprocessing of fast multislice magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to correct fetal motion has provided the first true 3-D MR images of the developing human brain in utero. Early approaches have used reconstruction based algorithms, employing a two-step iterative process, where slices from the acquired data are realigned to an approximate 3-D reconstruction of the fetal brain, which is then refined further using the improved slice alignment. This two step slice-to-volume process, although powerful, is computationally expensive in needing a 3-D reconstruction, and is limited in its ability to recover subvoxel alignment. Here, we describe an alternative approach which we term slice intersection motion correction (SIMC), that seeks to directly co-align multiple slice stacks by considering the matching structure along all intersecting slice pairs in all orthogonally planned slices that are acquired in clinical imaging studies. A collective update scheme for all slices is then derived, to simultaneously drive slices into a consistent match along their lines of intersection. We then describe a 3-D reconstruction algorithm that, using the final motion corrected slice locations, suppresses through-plane partial volume effects to provide a single high isotropic resolution 3-D image. The method is tested on simulated data with known motions and is applied to retrospectively reconstruct 3-D images from a range of clinically acquired imaging studies. The quantitative evaluation of the registration accuracy for the simulated data sets demonstrated a significant improvement over previous approaches. An initial application of the technique to studying clinical pathology is included, where the proposed method recovered up to 15 mm of translation and 30 degrees of rotation for individual slices, and produced full 3-D reconstructions containing clinically useful additional information not visible in the original 2-D slices.",

	abstract = "The development of the cerebral cortex, white matter microstructure, and the basal ganglia can be well characterized using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In this review, we analyzed structural in vitro MRI studies of transient cellular cerebral zones that are sites of neurogenetic events (proliferation, migration, cell aggregation, growth of axonal pathways, myelinization, and synaptogenesis). During early fetal life, from 9-13 postconceptional weeks, a thick, densely packed cellular ventricular/subventricular zone and ganglionic eminence indicate intensive proliferation of neuroepithelial stem cells. During the mid and late fetal phase, other cellular zones also became discernable: (1) the intermediate zone as a migratory and axonal growth zone; (2) the subplate zone as a synaptic, extracellular matrix-rich ``waiting'' compartment; and (3) the cell-dense cortical plate with postmigratory neurons. The preterm phase is characterized by the growth of cortical, thalamic, and striatal pathways; formation of white matter segments; and stratification within the subplate. Thalamocortical fibers cause lamination in the cortical plate, which leads to the formation of a substrate of sensory input. Preterm cerebral immaturity is characterized by considerable extracellular space at sites of axonal growth and a delineable subplate. The intensity of axonal growth, together with a high, gradient-dependent requirement for axonal guidance, forms a substrate for selective vulnerability of specific segments of cerebral white matter in the preterm brain. In summary, the combination of in vitro MRI, histologic analysis, and in vivo MRI is a promising new approach for studying the etiology and treatment of developmental disorders.",

However, the concomitant longer acquisition times increase the chances of subject motion adversely affecting the estimation of these measures. While correcting for motion artifacts improves the accuracy of DTI, an often overlooked step in realigning the images is to reorient the B-matrix so that orientational information is correctly preserved. To the best of our knowledge, most research groups and software packages currently omit this reorientation step. Given the recent explosion of DTI applications including, for example, neurosurgical planning (in which errors can have drastic consequences), it is important to investigate the impact of neglecting to perform the B-matrix reorientation. In this work, a systematic study to investigate the effect of neglecting to reorient the B-matrix on DTI data during motion correction is presented.

The method presented in this paper applies MI to measure the statistical dependence or information redundancy between the image intensities of corresponding voxels in both images, which is assumed to be maximal if the images are geometrically aligned. Maximization of MI is a very general and powerful criterion, because no assumptions are made regarding the nature of this dependence and no limiting constraints are imposed on the image content of the modalities involved. The accuracy of the MI criterion is validated for rigid body registration of computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR), and photon emission tomography (PET) images by comparison with the stereotactic registration solution, while robustness is evaluated with respect to implementation issues, such as interpolation and optimization, and image content, including partial overlap and image degradation. Our results demonstrate that subvoxel accuracy with respect to the stereotactic reference solution can be achieved completely automatically and without any prior segmentation, feature extraction, or other preprocessing steps which makes this method very well suited for clinical applications.",

The deformation is defined on a regular grid and is parameterized by potentially several thousand coefficients. Together with a spline-based continuous representation of images and Parzen histogram estimates, our deformation model allows closed-form expressions for the criterion and its gradient. A limited-memory quasi-Newton optimization algorithm is used in a hierarchical multiresolution framework to automatically align the images. To characterize the performance of the method, 27 scans from patients involved in routine lung cancer staging were used in a validation study.

	abstract = "Diffusion tensor imaging can be used to localize major white matter tracts within the human brain. For surgery of tumors near eloquent brain areas such as the pyramidal tract this information is of importance to achieve an optimal resection while avoiding post-operative neurological deficits. However, due to the small bandwidth of echo planar imaging, diffusion tensor images suffer from susceptibility artifacts resulting in positional shifts and distortion. As a consequence, the fiber tracts computed from echo planar imaging data are spatially distorted. We present an approach based on non-linear registration using B{\'e}zier functions to efficiently correct distortions due to susceptibility artifacts. The approach makes extensive use of graphics hardware to accelerate the non-linear registration procedure. An improvement presented in this paper is a more robust and efficient optimization strategy based on simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA). Since the accuracy of non-linear registration is crucial for the value of the presented correction method, two techniques were applied in order to prove the quality of the proposed framework. First, the registration accuracy was evaluated by recovering a known transformation with non-linear registration. Second, landmark-based evaluation of the registration method for anatomical and diffusion tensor data was performed. The registration was then applied to patients with lesions adjacent to the pyramidal tract in order to compensate for susceptibility artifacts. The effect of the correction on the pyramidal tract was then quantified by measuring the position of the tract before and after registration. As a result, the distortions observed in phase encoding direction were most prominent at the cortex and the brainstem. The presented approach allows correcting fiber tract distortions which is an important prerequisite when tractography data are integrated into a stereotactic setup for intra-operative guidance.",

We use diffusion-tensor MR imaging to test theoretical models that incorporate hypotheses regarding how these maturational processes influence water diffusion in developing gray and white matter. METHODS: Experimental data were derived from diffusion-tensor imaging of 167 participants, ages 31 gestational weeks to 11 postnatal years. An isotropic diffusion model was applied to the gray matter of the basal ganglia and thalamus. A model that assumes changes in the magnitude of diffusion while maintaining cylindrically symmetric anisotropy was applied to the white matter of the corpus callosum and internal capsule. Deviations of the diffusion tensor from the ideal model predictions, due to measurement noise, were estimated by using Monte Carlo simulations. RESULTS: Developing gray matter of the basal ganglia and developing white matter of the internal capsule and corpus callosum largely conformed to theory, with only small departures from model predictions in older children. However, data from the thalamus substantially diverged from predicted values, with progressively larger deviations from the model with increasing participant age. CONCLUSION: Changes in water diffusion during maturation of central gray and white matter structures can largely be explained by theoretical models incorporating simple assumptions regarding the influence of brain water content and myelination, although deviations from theory increase as the brain matures. Diffusion-tensor MR imaging is a powerful method for studying the process of brain development, with both scientific and clinical applications.",

Consistency testing is applied to evaluate retrospective correction of eddy current-induced image distortion in diffusion tensor imaging of the brain. In the literature several image transformations and similarity measures have been proposed, generally showing a significant reduction of distortion in side-by-side comparison of parametric maps before and after registration. Transformations derived from imaging physics and a three-dimensional affine transformation as well as mutual information (MI) and local correlation (LC) similarity are compared to each other by means of consistency testing. The dedicated transformations could not demonstrate a significant difference for more than half of the series considered.

The first algorithm uses conventional affine registration of each of the diffusion-weighted images to the unweighted (b = 0) image for each slice, while the second algorithm uses second-order polynomial warping. Similarity between images was determined using the mutual information (MI) criterion, which is the preferred 'cost' criterion for coregistration of images with significantly different image intensity distributions. We have found that subtle differences exist in the FA values resulting from affine and second-order polynomial coregistration and demonstrate that nonlinear distortions introduce artifacts of spatial extent similar to real white matter structures in the newborn subcortex. We show that polynomial coregistration systematically reduces the presence of erroneous regions of high FA and that such artifacts can be identified by visual inspection of FA maps resulting from affine and polynomial coregistrations. Furthermore, we show that nonlinear distortions may be particularly pronounced when acquiring image slices of axial orientation at the height of the nasal cavity. Finally, we show that third-order polynomial MI coregistration (using the images resulting from second-order coregistration as input) has no observable effect on the resulting FA maps.",

	abstract = "Normal fetal brain maturation can be studied by in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) from the 18th gestational week (GW) to term, and relies primarily on T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted (DW) sequences. These maturational changes must be interpreted with a knowledge of the histological background and the temporal course of the respective developmental steps. In addition, MR presentation of developing and transient structures must be considered. Signal changes associated with maturational processes can mainly be ascribed to the following changes in tissue composition and organization, which occur at the histological level: (1) a decrease in water content and increasing cell-density can be recognized as a shortening of T1- and T2-relaxation times, leading to increased T1-weighted and decreased T2-weighted intensity, respectively; (2) the arrangement of microanatomical structures to create a symmetrical or asymmetrical environment, leading to structural differences that may be demonstrated by DW-anisotropy; (3) changes in non-structural qualities, such as the onset of a membrane potential in premyelinating axons. The latter process also influences the appearance of a structure on DW sequences. Thus, we will review the in vivo MR appearance of different maturational states of the fetal brain and relate these maturational states to anatomical, histological, and in vitro MRI data. Then, the development of the cerebral cortex, white matter, temporal lobe, and cerebellum will be reviewed, and the MR appearance of transient structures of the fetal brain will be shown. Emphasis will be placed on the appearance of the different structures with the various sequences.

	abstract = "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Diffusion-weighted MR imaging studies of normal brain development have focused on premature babies who were free of focal lesions on conventional MR images. The condition of prematurity, however, is dissimilar to intrauterine life. We sought to establish normal values of fetal brain apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) to highlight its abnormal changes in pathologic conditions and to obtain information about normal brain development. METHODS: We measured the ADC, in utero, by using an echo-planar three-axes diffusion-sensitized sequence (b factor, 0 and 600 s/mm(2)), in frontal and occipital white matter and basal ganglia gray matter of 15 fetuses. Their gestational ages ranged from 22 to 35 weeks, and the postnatal MR images or sonograms revealed normal brain. RESULTS: Mean ADC value was 1.96 +/- 0.1 micro m(2)/ms (SD) in frontal white matter, 1.95 +/- 0.1 micro m(2)/ms in occipital white matter, and 1.56 +/- 0.1 micro m(2)/ms in basal ganglia. A significant negative correlation between ADC and gestational age was found for basal ganglia, whereas only a trend was present for frontal white matter. CONCLUSION: Although moderately higher, the ADC determinations we obtained are consistent with those reported in the literature in postnatal studies performed in premature babies.",

	abstract = "Patient motion and image distortion induced by eddy currents cause artifacts in maps of diffusion parameters computed from diffusion-weighted (DW) images. A novel and comprehensive approach to correct for spatial misalignment of DW imaging (DWI) volumes acquired with different strengths and orientations of the diffusion sensitizing gradients is presented. This approach uses a mutual information-based registration technique and a spatial transformation model containing parameters that correct for eddy current-induced image distortion and rigid body motion in three dimensions. All parameters are optimized simultaneously for an accurate and fast solution to the registration problem. The images can also be registered to a normalized template with a single interpolation step without additional computational cost. Following registration, the signal amplitude of each DWI volume is corrected to account for size variations of the object produced by the distortion correction, and the b-matrices are properly recalculated to account for any rotation applied during registration. Both qualitative and quantitative results show that this approach produces a significant improvement of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data acquired in the human brain.",

It addresses the key problem of fetal motion by proposing a registration-refined compounding of multiple sets of orthogonal fast two-dimensional MRI slices, which are currently acquired for clinical studies, into a single high-resolution MRI volume. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A robust multiresolution slice alignment is applied iteratively to the data to correct motion of the fetus that occurs between two-dimensional acquisitions. This is combined with an intensity correction step and a super-resolution reconstruction step, to form a single high isotropic resolution volume of the fetal brain. RESULTS: Experimental validation on synthetic image data with known motion types and underlying anatomy, together with retrospective application to sets of clinical acquisitions, are included. CONCLUSION: Results indicate that this method promises a unique route to acquiring high-resolution MRI of the fetal brain in vivo allowing comparable quality to that of neonatal MRI. Such data provide a highly valuable window into the process of normal and abnormal brain development, which is directly applicable in a clinical setting.",

	abstract = "In this paper we present a new approach for the nonrigid registration of contrast-enhanced breast MRI. A hierarchical transformation model of the motion of the breast has been developed. The global motion of the breast is modeled by an affine transformation while the local breast motion is described by a free-form deformation (FFD) based on B-splines. Normalized mutual information is used as a voxel-based similarity measure which is insensitive to intensity changes as a result of the contrast enhancement. Registration is achieved by minimizing a cost function, which represents a combination of the cost associated with the smoothness of the transformation and the cost associated with the image similarity. The algorithm has been applied to the fully automated registration of three-dimensional (3-D) breast MRI in volunteers and patients. In particular, we have compared the results of the proposed nonrigid registration algorithm to those obtained using rigid and affine registration techniques. The results clearly indicate that the nonrigid registration algorithm is much better able to recover the motion and deformation of the breast than rigid or affine registration algorithms.",

However, a given voxel may contain a distribution of fiber orientations due to, for example, intravoxel fiber crossing. The present study sought to test whether a geodesic, high b-value diffusion gradient sampling scheme could resolve multiple fiber orientations within a single voxel. In regions of fiber crossing the diffusion signal exhibited multiple local maxima/minima as a function of diffusion gradient orientation, indicating the presence of multiple intravoxel fiber orientations. The multimodality of the observed diffusion signal precluded the standard tensor reconstruction, so instead the diffusion signal was modeled as arising from a discrete mixture of Gaussian diffusion processes in slow exchange, and the underlying mixture of tensors was solved for using a gradient descent scheme. The multitensor reconstruction resolved multiple intravoxel fiber populations corresponding to known fiber anatomy. Ma",

The phantom results demonstrate that perfusion levels comparable with those found in vivo have easily observable and reproducible effects on signal amplitude that are consistent with previous IVIM theory. Reliable measurements of the diffusion coefficient in various types of brain tissue have been obtained. The results for white matter are consistent with the existence of anisotropic diffusion in oriented bundles of myelinated nerve fibers. The results for gray matter can be fitted to the IVIM theory and suggest a value of up to 14\% for the fraction of the signal contributed by randomly perfusing fluid in normal cerebral cortex.",

In our derivation of the registration procedure, few assumptions are made about the nature of the imaging process. As a result the algorithms are quite general and can foreseeably be used with a wide variety of imaging devices. This approach works directly with image data; no pre-processing or segmentation is required. This technique is, however, more flexible and robust than other intensity-based techniques like correlation. Additionally, it has an efficient implementation that is based on stochastic approximation. Experiments are presented that demonstrate the approach registering magnetic resonance (MR) images with computed tomography (CT) images, and with positron-emission tomography (PET) images. Surgical applications of the registration method are described.",
